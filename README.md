## UniqMerger: Unique Text File Merger

UniqMerge is a lightweight shell script designed to merge multiple text files into one, ensuring that only unique content is retained. It provides a simple and efficient solution for combining text files while preventing duplication of content.

### Features:

- **Merge Multiple Files:** UniqMerger allows you to merge an arbitrary number of text files into a single output file.

- **Unique Content:** When merging files, UniqMerger ensures that only unique content is added to the output file. This prevents duplicate entries and maintains data integrity.

- **Flexible Usage:** UniqMerger is easy to use and can be executed from the command line with a few simple arguments: the name of the output file and the names of the input files to be merged.

### How to Use:

1. **Download:** Clone or download the UniqMerger repository to your local machine.

2. **Execute:** Open a terminal window, navigate to the directory containing the UniqMerger script (`merge_files.sh`), and give execute permission with `chmod +x merge_files.sh`.

3. **Merge Files:** Run the script by providing the name of the output file and the names of the input files to be merged. For example:
   ```bash
   ./merge_files.sh merged.txt file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
   ```

4. **Verify:** Check the generated output file (`merged.txt`) to ensure that the merging operation was successful.
